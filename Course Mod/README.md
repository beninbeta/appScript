This is a Google Apps Script process we came up with for staff to submit new courses and modify existing courses.

Since it was created we have since moved this to App Maker, but the scripting could be useful in many regards as it uses html to
create side bars and has some logic built into it anyone might want to use.

There are certainly better scripts out there, but this served us well for about a year.
